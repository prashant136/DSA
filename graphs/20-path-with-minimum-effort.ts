/**
 * You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights, a 2D array of size rows x columns,
 *  where heights[row][col] represents the height of cell (row, col). You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0),
 *  and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e., 0-indexed).
 *  You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.

    A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

    Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.

    Example 1:
    Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
    This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.
    
    Example 2:
    Input: heights = [[1,2,3],[3,8,4],[5,3,5]]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The route of [1,2,3,4,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route [1,3,5,3,5].
    
    Example 3:
    Input: heights = [[1,2,1,1,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,1,1,2,1]]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: This route does not require any effort.

// ðŸ§  You're given a 2D heights grid. You can move up/down/left/right.
// ðŸ‘‰ The effort between two cells is abs(height1 - height2).

// Your goal is to find a path from top-left to bottom-right such that the maximum effort among all steps is minimized.
// This is a classic Dijkstra problem, but instead of summing edge weights, we take the maximum of current and next edge cost.
