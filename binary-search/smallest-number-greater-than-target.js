/***
 * 
 * 
 * You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order,
 *  and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.
    Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target.
    If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.


    Example 1:
    Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
    Output: "c"
    Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.

    Example 2:
    Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
    Output: "f"
    Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.

    Example 3:
    Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
    Output: "x"
    Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].
