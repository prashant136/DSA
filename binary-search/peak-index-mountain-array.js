/***
 * 
 * Peak Index in a Mountain Array
    An array arr is a mountain if the following properties hold:
    arr.length >= 3
    There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
    arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] 
    arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
    Given a mountain array arr, return the index i such that arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1].

    You must solve it in O(log(arr.length)) time complexity.

    Example 1:
    Input: arr = [0,1,0]
    Output: 1

    Example 2:
    Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
    Output: 1

    Example 3:
    Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]
    Output: 1

    return start; // or end both are same
