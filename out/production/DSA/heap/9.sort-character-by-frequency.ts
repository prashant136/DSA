/**
    Problem - Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters.
    The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

    Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

    Input: s = "tree"
    Output: "eert"
    Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
    So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

    Input: s = "cccaaa"
    Output: "aaaccc"
    Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
    Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

    Input: s = "Aabb"
    Output: "bbAa"
    Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
    Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
    

    Constraints:
    1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105
    s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.

/*
    Algorithm (Heap Approach)

    👉 Steps are:
    - Count frequency
    - Push into max heap
    - Extract highest frequency repeatedly
*/

/*
    🔥 Key Idea

    Heap is used when:
        You need repeatedly the highest / lowest element

    And heap guarantees:
        Top element = highest frequency (max heap)

    👉 Heap is a priority queue → always gives highest priority element first
