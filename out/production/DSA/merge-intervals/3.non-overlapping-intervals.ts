    🧠 Pattern Recognition

    If question says:
        Remove minimum intervals
        Avoid overlap
        Maximum non-overlapping meetings
        Schedule optimization

    👀 Non-Overlapping Intervals is actually a Greedy + Merge Interval

/*
    🚨 Biggest Insight (Interview Gold)

    We are NOT merging.

    We are choosing intervals smartly.

    Goal: Keep maximum non-overlapping intervals.

    Because:
        minimum removed = total intervals - maximum kept
    
    
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    🔥 Key Greedy Idea

    Always keep the interval which ends earliest.

    Why?
        Because it leaves more space for future intervals.

    Example:
        [1,100]
        [2,3]
        [3,4]

    If you keep [1,100] ❌
        Everything else overlaps.

    If you keep short ones ✅
    You can keep more intervals.

/*
    ✅ Step 1 — Sort by END Time (Important)

    This is the whole trick.

    intervals.sort((a,b) => a[1] - b[1])


    ✅ Step 2 — Track Previous End

    Take first interval.

    Then check overlap.

    Overlap condition:
        current.start < previous.end

    If overlap → remove one.

    Otherwise → keep it.

    🧩 Visual Example

    Input: [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4],[3,5]]

    After sorting by end:
        [1,2]
        [1,3]
        [2,4]
        [3,5]

    Process:
        Keep [1,2]
        [1,3] overlap ❌ remove
        [2,4] no overlap ✅ keep
        [3,5] overlap with [2,4]? No ✅ keep
