/**
 * The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of n daily price quotes for a stock
 *  and we need to calculate span of stock’s price for all n days.
 * The span Si of the stock’s price on a given day i is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days
 *  just before the given day, for which the price of the stock
 *  on the current day is less than or equal to its price on the given day.
    
    For example, if an array of 7 days prices is given as {100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85}, then the span values for corresponding 7 days are {1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6}
